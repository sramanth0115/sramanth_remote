1
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,530
Hike!

2
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,450
Martel!

3
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,450
Martel, you're a wimp!

4
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,880
I can't believe that.
Martel goes for a give-up slide.

5
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,260
-It did look cautious.
-I could have scored on that!

6
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,470
That could be the last play of the season.

7
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,760
In case you haven't heard,
the players' strike became official...

8
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,600
...at 4 p.m. Eastern time.

9
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,730
I'm sad that the players' demands,
which center around...

10
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,810
...a rise in the current salary cap,
have been rejected by the owners.

11
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,730
I have told my union brothers to walk.

12
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,780
Get me Jimmy McGinty!
Have him here tonight.

13
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,030
Yes, sir.

14
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,700
I'm here with Eddie Martel.

15
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,580
A lot of angry fans out there feel
that the players are being too greedy.

16
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,370
Anything you'd like to say?

17
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,540
Dwight, I know $5 million a year
sounds like a lot of money...

18
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,260
...but I have to pay 10 percent to my agent,
5 percent to my lawyer...

19
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,260
Do you know what insurance costs
on a Ferrari, mother...

20
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,600
Pat, back to you.

21
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,520
That was Washington running back
Malcolm Lamont.

22
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,100
It's all about money, folks,
but isn't it always?

23
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,570
Yes. This is Pat Summerall
for John Madden saying...

24
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,990
...so long from Nextel Stadium.

25
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,160
-You look like shit.
-I'm dying, Jimmy.

26
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,790
Come on.

27
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,660
You've been dying for 20 years.

28
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,880
-Give me a cigarette.
-I quit.

29
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,560
Nobody likes a quitter.

30
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,810
-See the game today?
-No.

31
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,310
Why, you liar.

32
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,400
Could you believe that slide by Martel?

33
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
What a pussy.

34
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,990
-What's up?
-Take a ride with me.

35
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,660
How's the wife?

36
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,670
She had her lips done.

37
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,000
I never even knew
you could have your lips done.

38
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,840
Looks like a largemouth bass.

39
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,180
I'm too old to screw around.
Let me give it to you straight.

40
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,480
I want you back.

41
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,270
-You already have a coach.
-I'll take care of it.

42
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,530
-Like you took care of me.
-Now, Jimmy...

43
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,190
Your players all flew home
to their castles...

44
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,820
...in their private jets.

45
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,070
We're gonna finish the season anyway.

46
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,540
I'm gonna use replacement players.

47
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,620
-Jeez, what a business.
-We've got four games left.

48
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,080
We win three, we're in the playoffs.

49
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,710
Really? Win three out of four
with replacement players?

50
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,420
That's not too much to ask.

51
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,510
You won for me once, you can do it again.

52
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,760
What's the matter, Jimmy?

53
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,270
Nobody's gonna give you
a better chance than this...

54
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,400
...after that Dallas mess.

55
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,400
-I was right about that.
-It had nothing to do with being right!

56
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,200
You went head-to-head
with an $8 million quarterback.

57
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,910
Who did you think was gonna win?
That's not gonna happen here!

58
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,580
I'm talking about a team
of poor nobodies who play to win...

59
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,830
...not a bunch of bitchy millionaires.

60
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,750
Come on, Jimmy!

61
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,590
I'm thinking.

62
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,430
Hello!

63
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,980
Hello!

64
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,290
I want total control of my team.

65
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,290
I want to be able to recruit anybody
that I want, no interference.

66
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,630
My word is my bond.

67
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,170
I want it in writing.

68
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,300
Okay, Jimmy.

69
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,850
Okay.

70
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,480
We thought we'd skip
special teams for now.

71
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,810
It'll be tough enough
to put together a team in a week.

72
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,610
-We're gonna go a different way.
-A different way?

73
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,070
Here's a list of people
I've been watching over the years.

74
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,320
They've all played football,
not all of them in the pros.

75
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,290
But they all have something
unique to bring to the game.

76
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,420
We'll take them and try
to put together a winning team.

77
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,710
If nothing else,
they should be fun to watch.

78
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,510
Daniel Bateman, SWAT team officer.

79
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,720
Awarded a Purple Heart for losing
a kidney during the Gulf War.

80
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,270
A walk-on at Michigan State
before he gave up football...

81
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,570
...to sneak back into the service
for one more tour of duty.

82
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,230
Clifford Franklin.

83
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,120
Great attitude, great desire, and
the fastest son of a bitch I've ever seen.

84
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,370
Clifford! Twinkie!

85
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,800
What's up, man? Got any Twinkies?

86
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,130
Can he catch?

87
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,600
That's why I have you.

88
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,610
André and Jamal Jackson.

89
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,610
Together, these guys were the best
tandem team of guards in the game.

90
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,950
-You're kidding me!
-André got traded and they fell apart.

91
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,080
He ain't our problem no more.
We gonna play football.

92
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,840
-Football?
-Football.

93
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,090
Nigel Gruff.

94
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,470
Striker out of Cardiff,
now residing in HelI's Kitchen.

95
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,270
He's called "The Leg" because he can kick
a soccer ball the length of the field.

96
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,730
Gentlemen...

97
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,110
...the drinks are on the house!

98
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,360
Bollocks!

99
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,280
Pissing away our money again?

100
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,740
-No, the money's on the way.
-Where? To the OTB?

101
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,620
I got a winning horse!
I swear on my mom's grave!

102
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,790
Your mother's grave?
He's swearing on his mother's grave!

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,130
Nigel, listen. I want my money!

104
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,050
-Has he kept in shape?
-By Welsh standards.

105
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,670
Shane Falco.

106
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,850
Shane Falco?
"Footsteps" Falco from Ohio State?

107
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,140
The same.

108
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,060
-He hasn't played in years.
-Should be well rested then.

109
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,650
You look like a swordfish I caught once.

110
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,990
He hit the deck just like that.

111
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,200
-You know who I am?
-Yeah.

112
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,410
You're Jimmy McGinty.

113
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,250
That old coach from the '80s.

114
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,210
We met just before the Sugar Bowl.

115
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,010
I remember.

116
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,640
Hell of a game that Sugar Bowl.

117
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,850
-What'd you lose that by? 40 points?
-That would be 45.

118
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,520
Sometimes a game like that sticks
with you. You never shake it off.

119
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,240
-Got three concussions to prove it.
-That's why girls don't play.

120
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,160
Why are you here, coach?

121
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,030
I'm back with the Sentinels.
I want you to quarterback.

122
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,870
I found the best guards
and a wide receiver...

123
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,580
...even you couldn't overthrow.

124
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,960
-I'm retired.
-Retired?

125
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,220
It looks like things have gone
real well for you since.

126
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,550
I got no complaints.

127
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,640
It's quiet here.

128
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,890
Nobody bothers me.

129
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,060
That's the great thing about plankton,
it pretty much keeps to itself.

130
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,240
You know what separates the winners
from the losers?

131
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,570
The score.

132
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,160
Getting back up
after being kicked in the teeth.

133
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,830
I watched films of your games
since the Sugar Bowl.

134
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,500
You shouldn't have been trying
to carry the whole team that first year.

135
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,050
Your teammates leaned on you
and you crumbled.

136
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,640
-Is that how you want to be remembered?
-I don't want to be remembered at all.

137
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,850
You're young. lf you do well,
who knows what'll happen after the strike.

138
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,770
I'm not making you any promises,
but why don't you take a chance?

139
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,070
Rather than scraping crap
off the bottom of somebody else's toys.

140
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,540
Think it over.

141
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,010
You could be part of something.

142
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm here to remind fans that what
the owners are doing is unconscionable.

143
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,310
They have blatantly hired scabs...

144
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,240
...which goes against our Constitution,
the Declaration of lndependence...

145
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,950
...and the Emancipation Proclamation.
Here come the scabs now!

146
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,870
That's Eddie Martel!

147
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,290
That's Wilson Carr!

148
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,960
Hey, Wilson!

149
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,630
I love you, man! What's happening?

150
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,500
I love you, man!

151
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,430
I'm gonna bust a cap in your ass,
and in your ass!

152
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,890
Piss off!

153
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,760
Piss off!

154
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,470
Get that bible out of here!

155
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,640
Sorry about this.

156
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,020
Put God in your heart!

157
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,030
I'm very sorry.

158
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,620
Get a job, you wankers!

159
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,070
Looking good out there!
You've got the goods!

160
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,570
Where did you learn to catch like that?

161
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,100
Roberts, make that D-back commit
before you cut, all right?

162
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,890
Jimmy.

163
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,020
-My tight end is deaf.
-Yeah, I know.

164
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,110
Jimmy, how am I gonna coach a deaf man?

165
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,400
You won't need to.

166
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,110
Brian Murphy would've gone
in the first round if he wasn't deaf.

167
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,160
Played college ball
here in D.C. at Gallaudet.

168
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,290
But I've got to be able
to communicate with him and how...

169
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,290
Learn to sign.

170
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,540
Horseshit!

171
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,670
Look at it this way,
he'll never be called offsides on an audible.

172
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,760
-Good to see you.
-You too.

173
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,840
-How are you?
-Good.

174
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,220
This is "The Leg"?

175
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,970
I thought you told me he was solid muscle.

176
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,940
He's much stronger than he looks.

177
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,060
I'm wiry.

178
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,320
Go get some kicks in.

179
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,780
He's "wiry."

180
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,450
"Wiry."

181
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,850
I'm sure you've been briefed
as to your situation.

182
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,600
Coach McGinty wanted you
with us for five weeks...

183
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,480
...and the Governor's complied.

184
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:57,940
Nice watch.

185
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,110
What?

186
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,400
This?

187
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,280
It's a fake.

188
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,150
Damn thing's always broken.

189
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,570
It's only right twice a day.

190
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,580
Why don't we join the others?

191
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,870
No sense standing here by ourselves...

192
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,910
...out of screaming distance.

193
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,130
-Come on, let's fire out of there!
-Jimmy.

194
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,510
-Falco, when's he coming?
-Relax, he'll be here.

195
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,880
Come on, quick feet!

196
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,720
I am relaxed, but that's not the point.
It's nervous energy.

197
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,430
Case in point:
We don't have a quarterback, do we?

198
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,690
-Fire out of there!
-We don't have a game plan for Sunday.

199
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,860
The only good thing I can say
about our one offensive weapon is...

200
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,480
...it's "wiry." What the shit is that?

201
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,950
No, no, it's "wiry."

202
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,160
-However the hell you say it!
-Say it: "Wiry."

203
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,250
"Wiry."

204
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,330
Holy! Look at this mamma-jamma!

205
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,520
Have you lost weight?

206
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,310
Coach, don't say that.

207
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,610
You look great.
Why don't you work out on SOD?

208
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,940
SOD.

209
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,610
-He's lost weight?
-Sumo wrestler.

210
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,950
Expert at pushing people around.
That's what pass blocking is, remember?

211
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,160
That's right.

212
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,370
Next one, 74. Come on!

213
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,500
Set, hut!

214
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,210
All right! Way to go!

215
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:34,510
It's all about pushing people around!
Set! Hut!

216
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,680
Come on, Sumo boy.
Let's see what you can do.

217
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,720
Set. Hut!

218
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,650
Yes! Good hit, Sumo boy!
Now get this off of me!

219
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,570
"That'll do, pig, that'll do."

220
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,700
-Screw you, cockroach.
-You'll have to find your dick first.

221
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,030
Get this off of me!

222
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,680
Hey, scab!

223
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,390
-I don't want any trouble.
-You hear that?

224
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,400
He's taking away my job,
but he doesn't want any trouble.

225
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,190
Not only is he taking your job,
he's taking your parking space too.

226
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,530
What's up?

227
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,070
Is that right, Falco?

228
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,370
I didn't know it was yours. I'll move it.

229
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,040
No, let us do that.

230
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,040
Guys, move the new boy's ride for him.

231
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,380
Coming right up, Mr. Falco.

232
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,380
Ready?

233
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,850
One. Two. Three.

234
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,770
Thanks, guys.

235
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,530
Asshole.

236
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,030
Jesus! "Footsteps" Falco.
They must be getting desperate.

237
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,700
Hey, Falco!

238
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,080
You're not even a has-been!

239
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,660
You're a never-was!

240
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,880
Go!

241
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,090
Come on, let's pick it up!

242
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Form a line here! Let's go seven on seven.

243
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,740
Check it out, it's our new quarterback.

244
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,160
We're in business now.

245
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,170
You're late.

246
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,670
Car trouble.

247
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,010
You still got an arm?

248
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,180
Hey, Falco.

249
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,270
Go!

250
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,790
That's gonna leave a mark.

251
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,510
-Leo, Franklin's down again.
-I'm okay.

252
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,220
I'm okay. I'm okay.

253
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,800
Let's play some football!

254
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,840
Danny Bateman.

255
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,710
Shane Falco.

256
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,260
Nice pop, Danny.

257
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,170
Thanks, coach.

258
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,300
In practice, we don't hit the fellows
with the red shirts on.

259
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,600
I know, but I see that red
and I just want to go after it like a bull.

260
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,900
Okay, Danny.

261
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,560
Huddle up!

262
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,120
Get used to setting up on the run.
Move fast, think even faster.

263
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,200
-You'll live longer.
-I'm very interested in that.

264
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,500
Huddle up!

265
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,760
Hey! Shane Falco.

266
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,100
I lost a ton of money
on that Sugar Bowl of yours.

267
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,310
What a bloody shambles that was.

268
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,350
You could smell the stink
all the way back in Wales.

269
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,230
Nice meeting you.

270
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,490
Ready!

271
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,240
Ready!

272
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,180
Hut!

273
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,150
Shit! I forgot about the whole red
shirt thing! This game's confusing.

274
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,570
Remember...

275
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,290
...red means stop.

276
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,370
Like a streetlight, right?

277
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,170
-Yeah.
-Get on up.

278
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,260
Go ahead. I'm gonna lie here
a moment and collect my thoughts.

279
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,970
Work shit out, right?

280
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,100
-You should be glad he's on your side.
-Yeah.

281
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,450
-So you have a cheer or something?
-Are you ready?

282
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,870
"Let's hear it for the quarterback
Hey-hey, ho-ho

283
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,540
"Could anyone play better?
Say-say, no-no

284
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,380
"Tackle, tackle, tackle, tackle

285
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,260

286
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,220
"lf I gave you a dollar
You could keep most of the change

287
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,720
"'Cause all I really want is a quarterback! "

288
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,230
"California oranges, Texas cactus

"Roll 'em up in toilet paper
Kick 'em to the moon! "

292
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,830
-That was great, thank you.
-Thank you.

293
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,200
Can you dance?

294
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,430
Let me have some of that duck.

295
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,100
-What the hell is this?
-Chinese spareribs.

296
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,100
If you don't want it,
get the fuck out of here.

297
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,400
I'm trying to figure out
how the Chinaman over here...

298
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:03,360
...gets 700 pounds off of eating this shit.

299
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,440
I'm Japanese, not Chinese.

300
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,650
-Same difference.
-What?

301
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,200
It's the same difference!

302
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,160
All that big...

303
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,460
Nigger, please.

304
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,130
You do know Japan and China
are two different countries, right?

305
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,050
-You do know I got an atlas, bitch?
-Really, gangster?

306
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,260
Yeah.

307
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,310
We're on the same team!
We're on the same team! Now chill out!

308
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,150
-The mick's right.
-I'm not a mick! I'm bloody Welsh!

309
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:39,980
Whatever.

310
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,820
-I'm going to sit with the deaf kid!
-Jesus Christ!

311
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,450
Praise his glory, Nigel!
You praise his glory!

312
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,790
"Slash 'em, slash 'em

"Come on, boys, let's kick some ass! "

316
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,890
I played one game in the pros,
I blew out my knee and that was it.

317
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,480
Shit.

318
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,360
All I want to do is score one touchdown
before I hang up my pads. That's it.

319
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,320
You'll get it.

320
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,210
Hey, man.

321
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,590
Wilkinson! Earl Wilkinson!

322
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,010
I knew I recognized you, man! I knew it!

323
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,220
You played for Minnesota, baby!

324
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,140
Oh, shit! Earl Wilkinson, man!
Oh, my God!

325
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,190
You'd have been All-Pro
if you hadn't beat up them cops!

326
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,860
What I had meant to say was "allegedly"...

327
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,200
...allegedly beat up them cops
and because...

328
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,740
...a good Christian boy like you
would never do nothing like that!

329
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,540
That's right.

330
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,790
The way I heard it,
my man didn't even do nothing anyway!

331
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,380
Them cops were just jealous
of the black man.

332
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,210
Hear what I'm saying?
My boy's been living large!

333
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,720
I can't stand the cops!
I better not see a cop!

334
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,890
-I'll whup a cop's ass! Believe it!
-I'm a cop.

335
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,110
Look!

336
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,820
Bundt cake!

337
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,240
-Look at these yummy little monkeys!
-Hello!

338
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,660
Oh, hey.

339
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,420
Yeah.

340
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,670
-Are you Heather and Dawn?
-Yep, we sure are.

341
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,670
You don't know how excited I am...

342
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,180
...that I actually have some girls
with dance experience!

343
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,720
-I'm excited too!
-I know! Me too, too.

344
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,770
So, Heather, you were in Cats,
which is so terrific...

345
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,110
No, Pussycats.

346
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,360
You know, the club next to the airport?
Pussycats.

347
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,450
-That style of dancing would be...
-Is lap-dancing a style?

348
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,410
No. I mean...

349
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,630
Oh, my God, I forgot to tell you something.

350
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,880
What?

351
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,710
She always does that.

352
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,180
I've seen all I need to see.

353
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,010
No way! I'm so excited!

354
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,180
Go suit up.

355
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,480
-Go down the tunnel and to the left.
-Okay.

356
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,650
If you guys have any friends down
at the club, would you send them over?

357
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,990
-Sure.
-Yeah, absolutely.

358
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,570
Where are you going, Number 48?

359
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,670
I was watching you today.

360
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,840
You looked good.

361
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,550
Good release, strong arm.
You're gonna do fine.

362
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,810
Thanks.

363
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,680
I'm Annabelle Farrell.

364
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,600
-Shane Falco.
-I know.

365
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,980
I remember you
from the '96 Sugar Bowl game.

366
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,860
Didn't anybody have anything
better to do that day?

367
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:22,280
You should get some help
to turn this back over.

368
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:26,410
Yeah, I was thinking
I'd call AAA later or something.

369
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,040
-Do you want a lift?
-Yeah.

370
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,090
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

371
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,180
Why'd you stay in the pocket at practice?

372
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,930
I don't comment to quarterbacks
about style but...

373
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,600
...you need to keep scrambling
against Detroit, with Prescott back.

374
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,610
-Prescott hasn't crossed.
-He will on Sunday.

375
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,570
-It's a secret so you can't prepare.
-How do you know?

376
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,410
My friend's a cheerleader for Detroit.
She tipped me.

377
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,160
He's left-sided,
shotgun formation, roll right.

378
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,120
Van Gundy's on the right.

379
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,210
He's been All-Pro two years,
but one of my cheerleaders...

380
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,710
...is friends with a girl
who broke up with him.

381
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,300
He's been drinking ever since she left him.

382
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,590
He's hung over! He's a good second
slower off the snap than usual.

383
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,340
I'll stick to the right side.

384
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,140
Unless what they say
about Martinez is true.

385
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,770
-That was fun.
-This is great! You live out here?

386
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,770
Which one's yours?

387
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,360
Here. You see that white yacht
with the satellite dish?

388
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,860
I'm the old houseboat next to it,
covered in seagull shit.

389
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,790
What did you name her?

390
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,450
Phyxsius.

391
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,380
-Phyxsius, what does that mean?
-"Putting to flight."

392
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,340
You want to come onboard for a beer?

393
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,050
Nothing personal,
but I don't date football players.

394
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,010
I don't blame you.

395
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,770
Not even quarterbacks?

396
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,520
Especially not quarterbacks.
You guys are the biggest babies of all.

397
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,480
The biggest babies?

398
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,980
Yeah.

399
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,650
-Thanks for the ride.
-Good luck on Sunday.

400
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,200
-Be careful out there.
-I will.

401
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,050
Shane.

402
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,170
What's up?

403
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,340
Just...

404
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,890
...watching the game.

405
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,680
Nervous?

406
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,980
No.

407
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,730
I'm good.

408
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,030
Like a duck on a pond.

409
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,030
On the surface everything looks calm,
but...

410
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,700
...beneath the water, those feet
are churning a mile a minute.

411
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,370
You'll be fine.

412
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,080
Find a way to lead your team.
Earn their respect.

413
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,000
Yeah.

414
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,050
How are you doing?

415
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,090
Me?

416
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,300
I'm just another duck on the pond.

417
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,020
Coach, can I ask you a question?

418
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,070
-Yeah, shoot.
-Why me?

419
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,240
I look at you and I see two men...

420
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,450
...the man you are,
and the man you ought to be.

421
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,000
Someday, those two will meet.

422
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,040
Should make for a hell of a football player.

423
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,550
Get some sleep, kiddo.

424
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,550
You play professional football tomorrow.

425
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,240
Welcome to Nextel Stadium,
in our nation's capital.

426
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,370
I'm Pat Summerall and with me,
as always, is John Madden.

427
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,540
Detroit bought an entire semi-pro team
once the strike happened.

428
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,420
Washington is going with
a bunch of unknowns.

429
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,840
Although we'll see a few guys
we know today.

430
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:16,720
Like Shane Falco, that talented quarterback
who fell out of sight...

431
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,430
...after a disastrous showing
in the Sugar Bowl.

432
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,110
Having a little snacky-poo
before the game?

433
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,900
-It does the body good.
-You are one crazy son of a bitch.

434
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,160
-You know how I know that?
-How?

435
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,160
Only a crazy son of a bitch
would eat eggs before a game!

436
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,700
I need to bulk up.

437
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,200
-You want one?
-No!

438
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,830
It's good for you.

439
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,050
Sentinels, listen up.

440
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,770
Welcome to professional football.

441
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,270
Some will say
that your accomplishments...

442
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,110
...will soon be forgotten, you're not
real players, this isn't a real team.

443
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,410
And I say that is bullshit!

444
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Because, as of today,
you're all professional football players.

445
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,330
You're being paid to play.
I want you to remember that because...

446
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,130
...the men whose places you've taken
forgot that a long time ago.

447
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,510
Bring it in here.

448
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,430
Bring it in, guys.

449
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,890
Let's play some football!

450
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,810
-D.C.
-All right!

451
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,680
For some of these players,
this is another shot...

452
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,900
...and a last shot for a guy like Falco.

453
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,440
Remember that beating he took
from Florida?

454
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,070
That's nothing compared to those beatings
he took in Seattle.

455
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,570
One thing we do know
is that Falco can take a hit.

456
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,370
Well, I'll tell you,
he's sure had a lot of practice at it.

457
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,220
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Washington Sentinels!

458
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:12,940
-Did you see that?
-That's a pretty good hit.

459
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,570
Will the medical trainers
please report to the east tunnel?

460
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,410
Maybe he was a little overanxious, huh?

461
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,750
And now,
the rest of the Washington Sentinels.

462
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,730
Kick-off!

463
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,370
Not bad, let's go!

464
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,920
There can only be one leader
out there, all right? You be it.

465
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:22,140
-That's where I stand.
-No, it's not.

466
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,690
-That's my spot in the huddle.
-It's not.

467
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,560
-Get to your spot.
-Let's go, chopstick!

468
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,230
Let's play football! What do you say?

469
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,330
-It's my spot now!
-Not for long, you tub of rice shit!

470
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,910
What's the problem?

471
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,120
You can't do jack shit!

472
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,500
-Pork rice!
-I'm Japanese, not Chinese!

473
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,250
Don't mess with my brother.

474
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,920
What's going on?

475
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,090
Something seems to be going on
in the huddle.

476
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,100
Falco's on his back.

477
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,810
They haven't had a play yet
and Falco's down.

478
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,190
He got hit by his own guy! He was
looking out his earhole for a minute!

479
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,980
This isn't a good sign.

480
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,530
-Am I hurt already?
-Your partner knocked your head off.

481
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,030
Let's go.

482
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,790
Come on, get it together!

483
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,380
I'm the quarterback.
I'm the only one who talks in the huddle.

484
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,750
-But he was in my spot.
-I don't give a shit!

485
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,050
Now huddle up.

486
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,430
If you've got something to say,
raise your hand.

487
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,060
Is that understood?

488
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,650
Suppose you don't feel good,
or you're hurt.

489
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,940
Tell me before the huddle starts. Okay?

490
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,110
Okay, here we go.

491
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,410
DC Right, Switch, 25 Blast.

492
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,780
What?

493
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,950
-That's to the left?
-The right.

494
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,250
To the left!

495
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,790
Be quiet or they'll hear us, and then what?

496
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,880
Play game!

497
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,100
Number 16 on the offense! Five yards!

498
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,680
Well Pat, so far the Sentinels...

499
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,810
...have minus 10 yards offensively.

500
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,520
I've seen monkey-shit fights
at the zoo more organized than this!

501
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,280
DC Right, Pro, 424 Tomahawk,
on one, on one. Ready?

502
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,460
Ready?

503
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,630
I'm coming for you, Footsteps!

504
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,760
Green 22!

505
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,680
Hut! Hut!

506
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,640
Come on, Shane!

507
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,900
You could hear Falco's fillings
drop all the way up here!

508
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,990
Detroit takes over the football
with excellent field position.

509
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,740
Give me an S!

510
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,450
Give me an E!

511
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,120
Give me an N!

512
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,750
Give me a T!

513
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,000
Give me an..."

514
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,750
I! "

515
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,130
We'll get them next time.

516
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,550
Eagle over, cover four!

517
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,100
On three, get ready!

518
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,190
All day, blue eyes!
It's Christmas morning...

519
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,020
...and Santa's coming down the chimney!

520
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,940
I'm gonna bury your family!
I'm gonna bury your dog!

521
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,360
Champ, champ!

522
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,580
Now that's football!

523
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,410
You get it? You like it?

524
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,920
The Sentinels have set a record
for penalties in the first three minutes!

525
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,010
-We're still waiting for the stats on that.
-Personal foul!

526
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,890
Number 56 on the defense!
Half the distance to the goal!

527
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,600
Bateman on that one.
That was just a cheap shot.

528
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,860
-That should be worse than a penaIty.
-They're walking right through us!

529
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,070
Touchdown, Detroit!

530
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,660
Don't worry about it.

531
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,890
Let's go!

532
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,270
Double-slot Zag, okay?

533
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,530
-What?
-I don't feel too good.

534
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,740
-Suck it up.
-Come on!

535
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,700
Jesus Christ!

536
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,080
-Eggs!
-That's ripe!

537
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,750
What'd you eat, man?

538
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,760
If we don't move,
I'm going to blow chow, too.

539
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,930
We're in a huddle! Double-slot zag, 88...

540
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,350
Jesus!

541
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,350
Goddamn!

542
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,440
I tried to tell you, I can't be around
somebody puking or I start puking.

543
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,150
Shit.

544
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,150
Okay, okay!

545
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,440
On three...

546
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,240
...everyone move left. Ready?
Hut, hut, hut.

547
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,080
What the hell is that?

548
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,170
What?

549
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,470
John, how many years have we been
calling games together?

550
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,760
Nineteen, I think.

551
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,680
Ever seen anything like that?

552
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,520
Not on a football field.

553
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,810
-What are they doing?
-Beats me.

554
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:55,400
Look at it this way. It's the first thing
we've done together as a team.

555
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,030
-Hey!
-Clean it up! Let's go!

556
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,440
Break!

557
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,260
Ready? Blue 42!

558
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,840
Blue 42!

559
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,430
Hut!

560
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:42,160
First down, Washington.

561
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,040
-Was it out of bounds?
-Yes, on 23.

562
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,170
-Blue Right, 60, X Post.
-Blue Right, 60, X Post!

563
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,380
Let's go, let's go!

564
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,890
Go, from four. Hut!

565
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,030
Now we're rolling!

566
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,910
Signs of life from Washington here.

567
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:19,370
That last completion by Falco
puts them back in field-goal range.

568
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,540
-Field goal, let's go!
-Field goal.

569
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,620
Nigel.

570
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,550
It's over the bar, not under.
Okay? Go get 'em.

571
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,760
-Hold that.
-Here comes the field-goal team.

572
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,430
A 40-yard attempt for kicker Nigel Gruff,
against the wind.

573
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,360
Here's a guy from Wales,
and he's kicking his first field goal ever.

574
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,400
This is a tough distance.

575
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,340
Yeah, she's there! She's there!

576
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,470
-Boom! Boom!
-Nigel Gruff kicks and scores!

577
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,180
Halftime score: Washington 3, Detroit 14.

578
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,490
That's the second time
a Washington player has been...

579
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,990
-...knocked out by his own teammate.
-There's a rule in sports:

580
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,500
Don't do anything great if you can't handle
the congratulations.

581
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,500
-There is?
-Yup.

582
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,000
Give me an S!

583
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,840
Give me an E!

584
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,510
Give me an N!

585
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,300
Give me a T!

586
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,300
Give me a...

587
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,110
Watch the wheel!

588
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,530
All right, let's go!

589
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,920
Touchdown, Smith! That one gets
the Sentinels back into the game.

590
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,010
This guy is a heck of a player,
but I don't know him.

591
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,260
According to the Sentinels,
it says Ray Smith is...

592
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,060
That's weird!
No college given, no high school.

593
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:28,310
Just says he's been a resident
of the State of Maryland...

594
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,310
...for the last two years,
and he likes to embroider!

595
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,320
-He does some fancy work with the ball.
-Weird.

596
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,580
Ready!

597
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,290
Green 11!

598
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,590
Green 11!

599
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,260
Falco's sacked and the ball comes loose.

600
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:01,430
It's Detroit's ball
with only a minute remaining.

601
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,100
Let's go! Let's go!

602
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,690
Danny, Danny.

603
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,020
I need that ball. Get me the ball.

604
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,360
You need the ball.

605
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,070
-Get me the ball.
-The ball.

606
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,780
Are you gonna get me the ball?

607
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,540
I hope he doesn't kill somebody.

608
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,500
I'm back! I'm back!

609
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,290
Get the ball!

610
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,020
I got it!

611
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,860
Now that is all-Madden team!

612
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,700
-You're the man.
-I'm the man!

613
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,530
-You got me the ball.
-I got you the ball!

614
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,080
-Go sit down now, Danny.
-Okay.

615
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,590
-Number 56 recovers the ball.
-Falco!

616
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,050
We've gotta pass.
It's gotta be in the end zone.

617
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,680
DC Right, Zig, 90 Eagle. You can do this.

618
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,270
All right? Let's do it! Come on!

619
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,830
-Blue 25!
-Here comes the pain, baby!

620
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,410
Blue 25!

621
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,840
-Check!
-What are you doing?

622
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,260
Check!

623
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,010
Black 32!

624
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,090
-What?
-He's changing the play.

625
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,470
He's checking off the run.
I told him to pass!

626
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,400
Shit!

627
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,260
Falco calls an audible
at the line of scrimmage...

628
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:27,270
...and Cochran almost has a touchdown!
What a heartbreaker for Washington.

629
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,280
Final score: Washington 10, Detroit 14.

630
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,790
If I'd wanted Cochran to have that ball,
I'd have called it that way.

631
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,580
-I read blitz.
-Bullshit.

632
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,750
I put the game in your hands.
You got scared.

633
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,080
I read blitz.

634
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,630
Winners always want the ball
when the game's on the line.

635
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,970
WFAN, the Sports Fan's Show.
How do you feel about the strike?

636
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,770
The fans are getting screwed. I've got
season tickets I can't give away!

637
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,650
-What about the replacement players?
-They're nobodies.

638
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:56,700
"At first I was afraid
I was petrified

639
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:00,880
"Kept thinkin' I could never live
without you by my side

640
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:05,170
"But then I spent so many nights
Thinkin' how you did me wrong

641
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,470
"And I grew strong"

642
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,050
Why'd you play that dumb-ass song?

643
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,850
I put on The Commodores.
That shit just came on.

644
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,850
Can somebody please cut that bullshit off?

645
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,440
-We did the best we could do.
-You don't get points for trying.

646
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,070
Let's face it, boys,
we screwed the pooch today.

647
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:27,160
Hey, there they are!

648
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:28,870
Ladies and gentlemen...

649
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,120
...your Washington Sentinels!

650
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,380
He's the luckiest guy here. At least
he couldn't hear the booing today!

651
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,720
Hello! Anyone home? Did I hear an echo?

652
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,260
Where'd McGinty get Rain Man?
The Special Olympics?

653
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:50,970
No wonder they couldn't win.
He can't even order a drink!

654
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,820
-Iay off.
-Iighten up.

655
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,480
It's not like he can hear.

656
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,780
I can.

657
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,330
What's that say?

658
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:12,250
"One good thing about being deaf,
you can ignore the assholes."

659
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,460
You asshole.

660
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,260
That's funny.

661
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,020
It's cool!

662
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,060
You had enough?

663
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,610
You've got shit for brains,
but you've got balls.

664
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,780
Thank you.

665
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,410
Danny, remember what I told you
about red shirts in practice?

666
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:43,120
Yeah.

667
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,040
-Forget about it.
-Okay.

668
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,410
Martel.

669
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:57,050
Who's the man? Who's the man?

670
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,840
Come on! Come on!

671
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,020
Come on, come on! Stop!

672
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,650
Let's play football, bitch!

673
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:16,820
We are all God's children here!

674
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,550
"And deliver thee into the hands
of brutish men"...

675
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,730
Ezekiel 21 :31 .

676
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,690
This is some more bullshit!

677
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,860
It's more of a homecoming for you.

678
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,950
You gonna be a funny man?

679
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,200
Bateman! Wilkinson!
Come on, guys, what are you doing?

680
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,040
Can't we all just get along?

681
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,380
Come on.

682
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,880
Why are we the only ones in this jail?

683
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:10,390
-Simple. They're winners.
-Hell, no. Not tonight.

684
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,180
That was pretty sweet,
you sitting on Wilson's head, Jumbo.

685
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,060
Thanks, Jamal.

686
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,650
He wasn't the only one
who kicked ass tonight.

687
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,160
You're the man tonight, Clifford Franklin!

688
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:30,910
What?

689
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,410
You were hiding behind the jukebox.
Wasn't he?

690
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,590
At first, I admit, I was afraid.

691
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:44,550
-Shit, I was petrified.
-You were petrified?

692
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,510
"Thinkin' I could never live
without you by my side"

693
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,350
-The Lord is by your side.
-Have mercy.

694
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:56,060
"And then I spent so many nights
thinkin' how you did me wrong

695
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,820
"And I grew strong"

696
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,360
You know I hate this damn song.

697
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:05,410
"I learned how to get along
And so you're back

698
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:07,410
"from outer space

699
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,580
"I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face

700
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:15,670
"I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key

701
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,800
"If I'd have known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me

702
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,180
"Go on, now, go

703
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,430
"Walk out the door

704
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:27,810
"Just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore"

705
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,230
Remember this?

706
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,100
"Weren't you the one
who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

707
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:36,780
"Did I crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

708
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,780
"Oh, no, not l
I will survive

709
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,580
"As long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive

710
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:48,460
"I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give

711
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,460
"And I'll survive

712
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,000
"I will survive

713
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,630
"Hey, hey!

714
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:13,230
"It took all the strength I had
not to fall apart

715
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:17,530
"Kept tryin' hard to mend the pieces
of my broken heart

716
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,740
"And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself

717
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:25,830
"I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high

718
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,750
-"And you see me"
-Four, five!

719
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,010
Okay, all right.

720
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:37,550
Frankie.

721
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,520
If anything like this bar fight
happens again...

722
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:49,480
...there'll be no place
on the team for any of you.

723
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:53,950
-Do I make myself perfectly clear?
-Yes, sir.

724
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:56,200
Just for the record...

725
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,710
...l would've loved to have seen
Martel get his ass kicked.

726
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,210
Let's get out of here!

727
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:11,300
Hey, Shane.

728
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:14,850
What are you doing?

729
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:16,470
My job.

730
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,310
-You're a professional football player.
-Sure, this week.

731
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,070
When that's all over, you know...

732
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,860
...I'll be back here.
I don't want to lose my customers.

733
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,490
I was on my way to work.
Do you need a ride?

734
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,950
I'm good.

735
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,250
-I got my truck back.
-How is it?

736
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:42,170
Flatter. But it runs.

737
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,470
And you?
How are you running after last night?

738
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:50,760
You heard about that?

739
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,230
I think the whole town heard about that.

740
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:55,640
Is that from the game or the fight?

741
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,940
I'm not sure. It's all blurred
into one big beating.

742
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,780
The good news is,
you guys got into a rhythm...

743
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:07,530
...apart from that vomiting thing,
which was on Sports Center.

744
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,160
Oh, God.

745
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,250
After that, the team was really clicking.

746
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,250
Yeah, it was starting to come together.

747
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,500
Yeah.

748
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,260
-You want to sit down?
-No, I should go.

749
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,300
Thanks for coming by.

750
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,270
-Wow. Ow.
-What?

751
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,020
Oh! Ow!

752
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,810
Jesus!

753
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,770
-It looks worse than it feels.
-It looks like hell.

754
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,740
-Then it looks exactly like it feels.
-Here.

755
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,990
Wild yam?

756
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,330
Yeah.

757
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:50,880
Don't laugh, it works.
It's great for sore muscles and bruises.

758
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,550
-I use it all the time.
-You don't have to do that.

759
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,680
Will you put it on? You can barely move.
This will be a little bit...

760
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,430
-Cold!
-Sorry, sorry.

761
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,720
Here, your shoulders.

762
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:09,400
Better?

763
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,900
Better.

764
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:23,410
You're the first player I can remember...

765
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,290
...who cares more about his teammates
than himself.

766
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,590
That's something this team's been
missing for a really long time.

767
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,260
It's a good thing you did last night.

768
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,300
It was just stupid.

769
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:41,980
Thanks.

770
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:48,730
-I'm gonna be late for work.
-Practice?

771
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,360
No, actually, I have work.

772
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,700
We only make $50 a game.
Gotta pay the bills, right?

773
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:58,370
Mac's, down on A Street.
Come in, I'll buy you a beer.

774
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,500
All right, I'll do that.

775
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,710
Keep putting that yam on.

776
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:24,770
Guys!

777
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,950
You gotta be kidding.

778
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:37,200
I didn't park in your space.

779
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,330
No, no.

780
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,420
But, unfortunately,
you did park in Lamont's space.

781
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:47,680
-He's not nearly as lenient as I am.
-On three, fellas.

782
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:58,900
-We got this. We got this.
-You want to put the car back?

783
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,940
This is none of your business.

784
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:02,980
Shane is our business.

785
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,070
-We're the guards.
-And we protect our quarterback.

786
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,200
This is funny to them bozos.
You got a joke? You got a joke?

787
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,920
That's your ride right there, ain't it?

788
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,750
Yeah.

789
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,930
That's my windshield!

790
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:26,350
-Now, put the car back.
-Son of a bitch!

791
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,520
Son of a...

792
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:32,390
Oh, son of a bitch? I'm a son of a bitch?

793
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,190
Stop, stop!

794
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,940
Come on, goddamn it, help me!

795
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,820
You're gonna pay for this!

796
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,160
No, I'm not. Stop messing
with my man, that includes his ride.

797
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:46,740
And wax that motherfucker.

798
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,200
Give it a tune-up, too.

799
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,580
Ready to go to practice?

800
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,960
Yeah, let's do that.

801
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:57,550
-How's that arm?
-Good.

802
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,510
What's that smell?

803
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,050
Wild yam.

804
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:03,640
-That's nice.
-You like that?

805
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:09,270
And so, boys and girls,
if anybody does have any firearms...

806
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,060
...you need to turn them in
as soon as possible.

807
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,650
No questions asked.

808
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,450
Understood?

809
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:23,830
All right.

810
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,830
Okay, coach, it's all yours.

811
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:38,350
Last Sunday, I saw a team on the field
play as hard as they could...

812
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,470
...to win the football game.

813
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:44,640
We lost. Not because of effort or desire...

814
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:49,110
...but because of lack of leadership
and trust. One's been resolved.

815
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:52,950
But leadership means nothing
if a team doesn't believe in each other.

816
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,820
Players spend years together
before they develop trust.

817
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,660
I'm asking you to do it in a week,
not a reasonable request, but...

818
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,120
...these aren't reasonable times.

819
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,050
I know you all have concerns
about this Sunday.

820
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,130
But a real man...

821
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,020
...admits his fears.

822
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,810
I'm asking you to do that here, tonight.

823
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:26,820
Who wants to start?

824
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:28,570
Let's talk about fears.

825
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,700
Fears.

826
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:38,870
I'm scared of spiders, coach.

827
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,250
-That's not what I meant.
-I'm afraid of spiders, too.

828
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:47,300
Goddamn spiders freak me, too, fellas.

829
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,180
Well, I didn't mean that.

830
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:53,470
Ever get one of those spiders
crawling up your arm?

831
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,560
-Crawling on you?
-Damn!

832
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:59,060
Thanks, Jumbo. You can just
rock me to sleep tonight.

833
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:05,030
Okay, that's great, but I'm talking
about what scares us on the field.

834
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,950
Like spiders on the field?

835
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,120
Can we get beyond the spiders, please?

836
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,580
Bees.

837
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:15,420
Bees?

838
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:17,040
-Bees?
-Bees.

839
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,760
Anybody here afraid
of anything other than insects?

840
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:24,470
Come on.

841
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:26,600
Quicksand.

842
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,140
Shit, yeah!
Quicksand's a scary mother, man.

843
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,770
It sucks you right in and even
if you scream, you get that muck...

844
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,770
I don't think that's it.

845
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,320
That's not what he had in mind.

846
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,240
-What's he talking about, then?
-Ask him.

847
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:47,490
What's up, Shane?

848
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:51,750
You're playing...

849
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:56,630
...and you think everything is going fine.
But then one thing goes wrong...

850
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,970
...and another...

851
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:00,510
...and another.

852
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:05,310
You try to fight back, but the harder
you fight, the deeper you sink.

853
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,520
Until you can't move.

854
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,900
You can't breathe...

855
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:14,690
...because you're in over your head...

856
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:17,900
...like quicksand.

857
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:28,420
That's some deep shit.

858
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,880
Anything else you're afraid of?

859
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,010
-Going back to the mini-mart.
-The shipping yard.

860
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:39,350
The auto plant.

861
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:41,180
Prison.

862
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,470
Yeah, all right.

863
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,070
The truth is,
you guys have been given something...

864
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,150
...that every athlete dreams of:

865
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,320
A second chance.

866
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,740
And you're afraid of blowing it.

867
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,700
We all are.

868
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:03,790
But now our fear is shared
and we can overcome it together.

869
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:07,790
Let's lose that fear this Sunday
and put it into San Diego!

870
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,710
Come on!

871
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:22,060
Another vicious hit
by the All-Pro Hank Morris.

872
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,020
That's his third of the game.

873
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,900
It's just me, dickhead.

874
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,150
I tell you,
he is really putting a hurt on Falco.

875
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:32,240
I'm not sure how much more
of this abuse he can take.

876
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,120
Huddle up!

877
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,700
Huddle up!

878
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,830
Same play, except let Morris by.
Nobody touch him.

879
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:45,250
-It's 16-0 already.
-I said let him through!

880
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,840
Get some penetration, Morris!
Get some penetration!

881
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,850
Blue 88!

882
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:07,740
Now, that is a hit!

883
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:13,000
Holy shit!

884
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:16,370
Let's haul ass, round boy!
Follow me! Follow me!

885
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,170
Holy shit!

886
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,510
Go!

887
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:29,470
Jump on his back!

888
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,270
Here it comes! I'm coming through!

889
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,310
Jump on his back!

890
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,440
Fumiko scores!

891
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:43,990
I love to see a fat guy score!

892
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,530
Why?

893
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:49,790
Because you get a fat-guy spike,
and then you get a fat-guy dance.

894
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:54,710
Pork rice!

895
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:01,590
That's not in the playbook.

896
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,680
Yeah.

897
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,010
Maybe we should put it in.

898
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,020
Kick-off!

899
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:44,850
So, Annabelle, what do you, like,
think of our friends?

900
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:47,230
I think...

901
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,730
...they're friendly.

902
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,610
I know! Aren't they?

903
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,440
Yeah.

904
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:07,250
We'll stretch them right here.

905
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:13,090
Green 95!

906
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:16,600
Green...

907
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:19,390
...95!

908
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,600
What the hell?

909
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:30,820
Start the ball! Get the ball off!

910
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:34,450
Hold the play clock.

911
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:41,790
Start the ball on the play clock.

912
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,220
False start on the offense.

913
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:54,970
Number 72, Number 77, Number 60...

914
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:58,230
...Number 61, Number 87 and Number 53.

915
01:07:58,440 --> 01:07:59,690
Five yards.

916
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,770
Still first down.

917
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:06,070
That's bullshit! The one girl slapped
the other girl on the ass, Jimmy.

918
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,450
You're killing me!

919
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,660
You want to see mine?
I got something for you.

920
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,340
-Here we go.
-Don't throw it!

921
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:30,930
Damn it! They did it again!

922
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:34,850
Ray Smith with the interception.

923
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,190
First down, Washington.

924
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,530
-Nice going!
-You're killing me!

925
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,860
-Defense, get out there!
-Iet's go.

926
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,370
Stop her from shaking her ass
for two minutes!

927
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:51,910
98 Shake.

928
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:53,330
98 Shake!

929
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:59,420
Green 99!

930
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:22,740
Not bad, Falco.

931
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:28,250
Touchdown, Brian Murphy.

932
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:34,380
Everybody in the stadium knows
that an onside kick is coming...

933
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:36,550
...with 55 seconds left on the clock.

934
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:41,010
With just 55 seconds left,
Washington has to recover the ball...

935
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:45,020
...call a time-out fast, so Gruff
will have a shot at a field goal.

936
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,190
Big Bateman ends up with the ball!

937
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,530
Danny, go down!

938
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,160
No one's gonna tackle him.

939
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,870
He's reversing his field!

940
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,870
He's forgot the clock's running out.

941
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,580
Well, he's trying to run out the clock.

942
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,080
Danny, go down!
You're using up the clock!

943
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:11,130
You won't see that every day.

944
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,800
Time out! Time out!

945
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,390
Nice hit, Shane!

946
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,350
What do you think?

947
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:22,140
We don't stop the clock, it's over.

948
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,940
Give me a chance, I'm bored.

949
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,440
You're looking at a 65-yard field goal.

950
01:10:28,570 --> 01:10:31,490
You just hold it,
and I'll kick the bloody piss out of it.

951
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,030
What the hell?

952
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:36,450
What the hell!

953
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:38,290
Field goal!

954
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:49,920
McGinty's gonna let Gruff
try this field goal from 65 yards out!

955
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,180
I don't know if he has enough leg.

956
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:54,100
I think he's smoking on the field.

957
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,720
Smoking? I'm sure you just imagined that.

958
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:59,940
No, I saw the smoke and everything.

959
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,200
Vito! Look who's on TV!

960
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,790
He wants to keep his pub,
he's gonna stop blowing some kicks!

961
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,500
I'm telling you, that's him.

962
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:49,530
It's straight enough.
lf it's got the distance...

963
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:53,120
It has the distance! It's good!
Washington wins!

964
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:59,920
The 65-yard field-goal attempt
is good by Nigel Gruff.

965
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:08,180
Final score: Washington 17, San Diego 16.

966
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:18,240
-You're the man!
-Oh, bollocks!

967
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,030
Come here!

968
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,210
Sorry, man. Sorry, excuse me.

969
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:32,750
All right. Good game.
We snuck by on that one.

970
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,420
-I'll take it.
-All right.

971
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,220
I'll take it. Congrats.

972
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,060
-What do you think of the new team?
-It's great!

973
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:45,770
These guys are like us.

974
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:49,230
This strike ain't about guys like me.
It's about them superstars...

975
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,900
...who want $8 million
instead of $7 million. To hell with them.

976
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:57,160
This is the most fun I've had
in football in years. Go Falco!

977
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,580
All right. Let's go, baby, let's go!

978
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:05,750
-I love you, Annabelle.
-I know you do, Alan. We're closed.

979
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,630
Oh, hey!

980
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,420
-You can come in.
-Come on in, buddy!

981
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:13,090
You go.

982
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,720
Out, out!

983
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:16,130
You're Shane Falco.

984
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:20,560
-Way to go. You guys kick ass!
-Thanks.

985
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,980
-Way to go.
-Bye! Take care.

986
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,940
Hi.

987
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:30,650
Sure it's okay? I don't want to get you
in trouble with your boss.

988
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:34,570
No, she won't mind.

989
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:36,780
Come on in. You want a beer?

990
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,160
Sure.

991
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:43,210
We were so tight.
We had so much fun in here.

992
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,630
Since I was five years old,
I've been sitting on those stools.

993
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,590
And then after he died, I took over.

994
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,430
Is that you and him?

995
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,970
Yeah.

996
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:02,060
He was the biggest Washington fan
you have ever seen.

997
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:06,360
Other kids got bedtime stories,
I got football stories.

998
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,320
He used to talk all the time...

999
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:15,830
...about the glory days of football.

1000
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,870
Said how they were...

1001
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,830
...gone forever.

1002
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,300
I wish he was here to see you guys play.

1003
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,180
-I don't know about that.
-I do.

1004
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:29,590
Good game today.

1005
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,100
Thanks.

1006
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,860
It's late.

1007
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,990
Yeah.

1008
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,660
Us babies need our rest.

1009
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:54,420
Yeah, you do.

1010
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,630
I'm sorry, but between the guys
on the field...

1011
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:00,800
...and the guys in the bar,
a girI's gotta keep her guard up.

1012
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,050
Yeah, I imagine.

1013
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,680
Yeah.

1014
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:08,510
You coming to the game on Sunday?

1015
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,890
No, we don't travel with the team.

1016
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:17,320
Can I see you when I get back?

1017
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:20,940
Sure.

1018
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:27,540
Good night, Annabelle.

1019
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:30,210
Good night.

1020
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:19,550
-What do you do here, John?
-You go for it. You have to.

1021
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:24,310
But Falco's been shut down
by this defense all afternoon.

1022
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:30,320
But I'll tell you this, all it takes...

1023
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:33,990
...is one big play to get him back
in the ball game.

1024
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,990
And here goes Falco.

1025
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:52,470
Falco scores! Falco scores!

1026
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:03,480
Here's Falco. He'll try to reverse pivot,
turn and pitch out here.

1027
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:07,820
But in doing so, his left guard,
André Jackson, is going to pull...

1028
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,910
...and Falco will hit him
with the ball in the back.

1029
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,830
Then it's gonna flop around the ground.

1030
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:17,540
Here comes Cochran, he'll kick it.
Franklin's gonna pick it up.

1031
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,040
Franklin's gonna get hit right here.

1032
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,340
The ball will go flying in the air.
Falco will pick it up...

1033
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:28,510
...and the guy who started the play, Falco...

1034
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,470
...will end up with it
in the end zone for a touchdown!

1035
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,640
-Welcome to strike football.
-And the fabulous Falco.

1036
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,770
If they can win against Dallas...

1037
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:41,020
...they'll do what Washington
hasn't done in over seven years:

1038
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:42,440
Get to the playoffs.

1039
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,330
Call time out! Time out!

1040
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,500
Time out!

1041
01:17:56,290 --> 01:17:58,420
Time out Washington.

1042
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:01,130
Franklin, come here, come here, come on.

1043
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,340
I thought I had it...

1044
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,680
Shut up. Give me the Stick 'em.

1045
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:09,260
-That's illegal.
-Think you'll go to football jail?

1046
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,140
Now, you know this don't look natural.

1047
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:16,190
Don't talk. We'll run the same play.
You'll catch the ball.

1048
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:18,730
I look like I just jacked off an elephant!

1049
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,320
Say you understand.

1050
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,240
I understand.

1051
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:25,620
Go out there and catch the ball
for a change, all right?

1052
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,880
Damn! This cup is stuck!

1053
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,670
Gonna need some time on this one.

1054
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,970
Here we go. Same play.
Pro Right, Switch 9...

1055
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,680
Franklin!

1056
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:45,310
I can't get the damn cup off!

1057
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,480
You can do this.

1058
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,940
It's one on one. Ready?

1059
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,700
Ready!

1060
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,410
Blue 89!

1061
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,120
Blue 89!

1062
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:23,470
Franklin catches the ball!

1063
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:26,560
Who would've thought?
He never catches a ball.

1064
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:28,440
But he caught the ball!

1065
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:30,980
That makes the score 21 to 20.

1066
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:34,950
Conventional wisdom says
kick the extra point, tie the game...

1067
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,700
...and go into overtime.
Especially with the playoffs on the line.

1068
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:42,870
But Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy.

1069
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,830
And McGinty says, "Go for it."

1070
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,580
Let's go for the win!

1071
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,760
I need a receiver!

1072
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:54,510
4-22 Y Cross, okay? We gotta have it!

1073
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:03,020
Ready? Go! Ready!

1074
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:11,860
This kind of situation has not been
Falco's strong point in the past.

1075
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:14,410
Falco rolls to his left and throws...

1076
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:18,500
...right into the defender's hands.

1077
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:22,630
And he drops it right into the unsure hands
of Clifford Franklin!

1078
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,090
Washington wins!

1079
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:28,220
What a lucky break for Shane Falco,
who threw a bad pass...

1080
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,840
...that could've blown the game
for Washington.

1081
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,700
Get over it.

1082
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,370
It's a win.

1083
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,740
Better lucky than good?

1084
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,370
Right.

1085
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,300
Shane Falco.

1086
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:06,090
-Great game out there today.
-Thanks.

1087
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:10,390
To what do you attribute this team's
sudden rise over these past few weeks?

1088
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,390
You know, you should talk to Franklin.
He's the hero today.

1089
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,480
Clifford Franklin. Terrific day today.

1090
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:20,440
Yeah, today was a good day
for Clifford Franklin.

1091
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:22,820
Clifford Franklin can't wait till tomorrow.

1092
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:25,620
Clifford Franklin gets better looking
every day.

1093
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:30,410
We're beginning to scratch the surface
of the talents of Clifford Franklin.

1094
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:33,920
Clifford Franklin has moves even
Clifford Franklin ain't seen yet.

1095
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:37,460
You showed us a few moves
today against Phoenix...

1096
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:40,220
...but it could be a different story
against Dallas.

1097
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,760
That's the same story, different chapter.

1098
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:46,810
The football is like a one-man cold
to Clifford Franklin.

1099
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:51,190
Clifford Franklin's the only one catching it
and coming down with it.

1100
01:21:58,610 --> 01:21:59,820
Cheers, babe.

1101
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:02,030
I think we got it.

1102
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:05,830
To victory!

1103
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:10,670
Feels good, doesn't it?
One game away from the playoffs?

1104
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,840
And the hunt? That ring's so close
you can almost feel it on your finger.

1105
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:16,880
-What are you up to?
-What?

1106
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:20,550
I can't get excited about the future
of my team?

1107
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:25,060
Okay, I got some great news.

1108
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:28,440
Martel and Carr have crossed
the picket line.

1109
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:32,650
With the deal I made them swallow,
I can't afford not to take them back.

1110
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:33,940
No.

1111
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,820
No what?

1112
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,660
I'm sticking with Falco.

1113
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:40,660
Jimmy, come on.

1114
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,750
Have you read the newspaper?

1115
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:47,130
The entire Dallas team
has crossed the picket line.

1116
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,750
Thanksgiving night
we play the world champions.

1117
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,550
We have a deal.
No interference with my coaching.

1118
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:56,720
As long as the strike is on,
Falco is my quarterback.

1119
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:59,890
We have to beat Dallas
to get into the playoffs.

1120
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,480
Falco can't do that.
You saw what happened yesterday.

1121
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,520
Jesus Christ!

1122
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:09,030
Do you think he'll have
that luck against Dallas, too?

1123
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,950
-They'll murder him!
-He's just getting his game back.

1124
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:14,570
He falls apart
whenever the game is on the line!

1125
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,080
That's been his rap
ever since the Sugar Bowl.

1126
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,210
There are 21 other guys
who put their faith in you to lead them.

1127
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,710
They'd be heartbroken
if you abandoned them...

1128
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:27,000
...before the biggest game of their lives.

1129
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,550
You really are a son of a bitch,
you know that?

1130
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,520
What are you doing?

1131
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:45,360
I don't want to make
the same mistake I did in Phoenix.

1132
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:47,820
We might end up
in that situation with Dallas.

1133
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,990
They like to send their safeties...

1134
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,040
...put the pressure on.

1135
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,330
Yeah, coach?

1136
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:58,830
It's over.

1137
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:00,290
Martel crossed.

1138
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,090
I'm sorry.

1139
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:24,490
"Chokes with the game on the line."
ls that what O'Neil said?

1140
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:33,870
It's okay.

1141
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:36,380
It's better for the team, right?

1142
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,500
I mean, Martel...

1143
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:42,300
...he is the best. The guy's got it all.

1144
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,010
No.

1145
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,890
He doesn't have heart.

1146
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:50,310
You do.

1147
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:57,070
It's been a privilege.

1148
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,660
Thanks for believing.

1149
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:15,380
You give them hell on Thursday.

1150
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:45,460
I just wanted to tell you before you left...

1151
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,960
I'm sorry.

1152
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,710
-Thanks.
-No, really.

1153
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:54,090
I think it's terrible
what they do to you guys.

1154
01:25:57,090 --> 01:26:00,850
They make you believe
that you're better than you really are.

1155
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:03,190
Then they pull the rug out from under you.

1156
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:09,440
The cruelest thing
that they can give guys like you...

1157
01:26:10,110 --> 01:26:11,070
...is hope.

1158
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:19,410
You're a real class act, Martel...

1159
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,040
...a real class act.

1160
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,340
She deserves better.

1161
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:31,550
You're a sinking ship.
Don't drag her down with you.

1162
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,970
Take care of my guys.

1163
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,900
Come on, boys, let's go!

1164
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,480
Nothing but water left in here. Let's go.

1165
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:47,360
I have a date.

1166
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:50,990
-But I love you, Annabelle.
-I know you do, Alan.

1167
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:53,370
'Bye, you guys. Be careful!

1168
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,390
Here he is!

1169
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,640
Ladies and gentlemen...

1170
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,690
...Number 16 in your programs...

1171
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:58,530
...Number 1 in your hearts!

1172
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:01,410
Shane Falco!

1173
01:28:04,030 --> 01:28:05,200
Falco! Falco!

1174
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,790
Cheers. God bless you.

1175
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,210
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1176
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:25,220
Are you all right?

1177
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,900
I'm done.

1178
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,060
What?

1179
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,730
Martel crossed.

1180
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,320
Bloody hell.

1181
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,740
When will you tell the guys?

1182
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:41,410
-I don't want to ruin...
-No, no, wait.

1183
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:45,750
Cut that music! Cut it!
Turn the music off! Cut it!

1184
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,250
Shane's got something to tell you.

1185
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,710
I've got good news.

1186
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:56,510
This Thursday you'll be with
the best quarterback in the league.

1187
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,510
Damn right.

1188
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,600
Martel.

1189
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:04,560
He crossed.

1190
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:10,280
Martel crossed.

1191
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:17,870
While you guys are getting pounded
by Dallas...

1192
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,290
...just kidding...

1193
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:24,080
...I'll be drinking beer on my boat.

1194
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:26,130
Kicking back.

1195
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:30,470
Sentinels...

1196
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:33,010
...raise your glasses.

1197
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,430
This is to Shane Falco.

1198
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:38,020
He's our quarterback.

1199
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:40,020
He's our leader.

1200
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:44,270
But most of all, he's our friend.
This is for you, man.

1201
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:45,730
To Falco!

1202
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:50,990
Thanks.

1203
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:52,870
Thanks.

1204
01:29:54,370 --> 01:29:55,830
It's been fun.

1205
01:31:20,010 --> 01:31:23,350
Welcome back to Nextel Stadium
in our nation's capital.

1206
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,770
I'm Pat Summerall and with me,
as always, is John Madden.

1207
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,270
It appears that the strike
is coming to a close.

1208
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:33,440
Martel will be resuming
the quarterback position tonight.

1209
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:35,860
I gotta admit, I was looking forward...

1210
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:39,320
...to seeing what Falco could do
with one more game.

1211
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:42,330
He made amazing progress
the past few weeks...

1212
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:44,580
...under the tutelage of Jimmy McGinty.

1213
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:45,660
He really did.

1214
01:31:45,870 --> 01:31:50,000
But tonight it'll be Martel
leading Washington against Dallas.

1215
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:01,770
I never thought I'd say this, but...

1216
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:04,770
...I'm gonna kind of miss
those replacement games.

1217
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:06,940
Bring back Falco!

1218
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:11,360
ladies and gentlemen,
leading your Washington Sentinels today...

1219
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:14,910
...welcome back Number 7, Eddie Martel.

1220
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,330
Go on, boys!

1221
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,020
Red 21!

1222
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,650
Come on, Martel. Get moving!

1223
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,650
Maybe you should try scrambling.

1224
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:52,530
Brilliant. How about a quick kick?

1225
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:12,350
Hey, Butler.

1226
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:17,100
-Red 38!
-Hey, man.

1227
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:20,730
If it ain't any trouble,
I'd love to get your autograph after.

1228
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:22,940
You want it, you got it, scab!

1229
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:24,440
All right.

1230
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:46,590
Cochran fumbles the ball, Dallas recovers.

1231
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,600
First down and goal on the two-yard line.

1232
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:53,810
Hawk 9, Stay!

1233
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:57,320
Bateman! Hawk 9, Stay!

1234
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,900
Hawk 9, Stay!

1235
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:02,450
I'm back!

1236
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:09,620
Touchdown, Dallas.

1237
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:15,960
They're quitting on you!

1238
01:34:23,970 --> 01:34:25,140
Gold 41!

1239
01:34:38,190 --> 01:34:41,120
Pass intended
to Brian Murphy, incomplete.

1240
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:43,490
Throw right, you're going left!

1241
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,580
Right, right, right.

1242
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:48,080
You went left, I want you to go right!

1243
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:50,460
No, right!

1244
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:51,880
Right, you idiot!

1245
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,720
Hey, easy!

1246
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:20,490
Brian Murphy fumbled the ball.
Dallas recovers.

1247
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,080
Nice hands.

1248
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:27,500
Three-two Magic, Rack Zero.

1249
01:35:27,710 --> 01:35:29,670
What the hell was that about?

1250
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:45,980
Touchdown, Dallas.

1251
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:26,280
Gruff, wake up!

1252
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:37,580
What the...

1253
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:40,250
Pass incomplete by Eddie Martel.

1254
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,850
What the hell was that?

1255
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:49,600
I'm talking to you!

1256
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,430
I call the plays out on the field.

1257
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,980
-That's not how I coach.
-I don't give a shit...

1258
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:56,310
...because that's the way I play.

1259
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:59,230
That's the end of the first half...

1260
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,900
...with a score of Dallas 17, Washington 0.

1261
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:03,110
Coach McGinty!

1262
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,990
What will Washington need
to get back into this game?

1263
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:10,160
-Heart.
-I'm sorry?

1264
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:11,920
You've gotta have heart.

1265
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,630
Can you elaborate?

1266
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:17,880
Miles and miles of heart.

1267
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:22,970
There you have it,
in a word, from Coach McGinty...

1268
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:26,350
... Washington will need "heart"
to get back into this...

1269
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,020
I ran it like you said!
You just underthrew me!

1270
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:36,610
This isn't a track meet, asshole.
You have to look for the ball!

1271
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,740
I'll pull you off the field, you spoiIt punk.

1272
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:45,740
Is O'Neil gonna side with a burnout coach
or someone who puts fans in the stands?

1273
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,080
Son of a bitch!

1274
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:51,500
What are you thinking about?
We got a game to play!

1275
01:37:51,750 --> 01:37:54,300
-No one can beat Dallas with these losers!
-I can.

1276
01:37:58,050 --> 01:38:01,470
Falco, great to see you.
Now, get the hell out of my locker room!

1277
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:03,600
-Coach?
-What took you so long?

1278
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:05,060
Traffic.

1279
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:07,270
Suit up!

1280
01:38:07,770 --> 01:38:08,350
What?

1281
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:12,610
-O'Neil will fire your ass!
-It won't be the first time!

1282
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:14,990
This is bullshit! I'll end this right now.

1283
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,860
Come and get some!

1284
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:22,700
You big fatty!

1285
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:32,260
This doesn't change anything.

1286
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:35,260
I'm an All-Pro quarterback!
I've got two Super Bowl rings!

1287
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:37,350
You're no more than a replacement.

1288
01:38:37,550 --> 01:38:38,720
Yeah.

1289
01:38:40,220 --> 01:38:41,930
I can live with that.

1290
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:47,570
My brothers, will somebody
please get this asshole out of here?

1291
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:51,320
Get your hands off me, you gorilla!

1292
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:05,170
Jimmy McGinty is anything
but a conventional guy.

1293
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:09,050
And McGinty says, with the playoffs
on the line, "Go for it. "

1294
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:11,720
Get to the playoffs.
Something Washington...

1295
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:15,220
...has not been able to do
against Dallas in seven years.

1296
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:30,950
Falco?

1297
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,580
What the hell is he up to?

1298
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:37,580
Look, here comes Falco! Falco's back!

1299
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:39,290
What happened to Martel?

1300
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,710
I don't know, but the way Falco's running...

1301
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,510
...and that look he has in his eye,
he thinks he's gonna play.

1302
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:51,010
I'm sorry.

1303
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:55,980
They're playing zone out there
and you can pick them apart...

1304
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:57,690
...if you keep your eyes open...

1305
01:39:57,770 --> 01:40:02,150
He seems to be necking with
that cheerleader! That's what he's doing!

1306
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:06,530
Players aren't supposed to be
fraternizing with cheerleaders.

1307
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:09,410
Yeah, but what are they gonna do?
Fire him?

1308
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,370
-You give me strength.
-You're late for work.

1309
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:15,960
Kick ass, Falco!

1310
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:22,300
What's all the celebrating about?
We're down 17-0.

1311
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,140
It's nasty out there.

1312
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:26,680
That's why girls don't play
the game, coach.

1313
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:31,140
Listen up. This time tomorrow,
the strike will be officially over.

1314
01:40:31,890 --> 01:40:34,980
Dallas has made a big mistake.
They haven't been afraid of you.

1315
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:38,570
They should be, because you have
a powerful weapon working for you.

1316
01:40:38,780 --> 01:40:40,820
There is no tomorrow for you.

1317
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:43,620
That makes you all very dangerous people!

1318
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:52,290
Kick ass on one. Ready?

1319
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:03,890
Clifford Franklin is looking for a new home.

1320
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:06,520
Ready for some pain?

1321
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:08,810
-Bring it on.
-It's coming.

1322
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:10,650
It's coming.

1323
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:12,570
See him coming in motion?

1324
01:41:16,700 --> 01:41:18,490
I've never seen anything like this!

1325
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:19,870
Unbelievable!

1326
01:41:21,200 --> 01:41:24,870
There's at least five, six flags out there.
Hats, everything!

1327
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:27,540
This is what you call
an old-fashioned melee.

1328
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:30,840
Unnecessary roughness,
Number 16 and Number 34.

1329
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:33,840
Fifteen yards, so that's, wait...

1330
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:36,260
...45...30...

1331
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:41,020
How many yards so far?

1332
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:43,520
Who do they think they're playing here?

1333
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:51,700
Let's go! Come on!

1334
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:18,600
My knee!

1335
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:20,440
It's my knee!

1336
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,190
I think I broke it.

1337
01:42:30,780 --> 01:42:32,160
Did I do it? Did I score?

1338
01:42:32,370 --> 01:42:34,910
-Yeah, you did it.
-God, it hurts!

1339
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,080
I'm sorry.

1340
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:39,670
Don't be sorry. Going out
in front of 80,000 people ain't bad.

1341
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:43,630
You finish what you started.

1342
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:50,760
White 24!

1343
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:09,410
Blue 15! Hut, hut!

1344
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:40,320
First down, Washington.

1345
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:44,990
-Good job.
-I got skills.

1346
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:48,290
-Feel like running the ball?
-Better give it to Wilkinson.

1347
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,210
He's going to jail.

1348
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:54,130
-I'll clear the way.
-I'm right behind you.

1349
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,880
We need it!

1350
01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:13,280
A gain of 20 yards by Ray Smith.
First down.

1351
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:22,450
I know you're tired. I know you're hurting.

1352
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:25,580
I wish I could say something
classy and inspirational...

1353
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:27,460
...but it wouldn't be our style.

1354
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:31,250
Pain heals.

1355
01:44:31,590 --> 01:44:33,300
Chicks dig scars.

1356
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:36,180
Glory lasts forever.

1357
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:37,590
Right on, Shane.

1358
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,260
Right on, baby!

1359
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:42,480
Shotgun, DC Right.

1360
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:45,770
Flip 90, Dig, on the center. Ready?

1361
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:05,290
We're looking at a different team here
in the second half.

1362
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:09,510
Absolutely. Washington is playing
like there's no tomorrow...

1363
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:11,300
...because there isn't.

1364
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:13,930
Touchdown, baby!

1365
01:45:14,180 --> 01:45:15,180
Son of a bitch!

1366
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:19,690
Odd bullets, blitz coverage!

1367
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:32,990
Daniel Bateman comes up
with the big stop on third and one.

1368
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,540
That forces a Dallas punt.

1369
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:39,620
Pat, with 28 seconds remaining,
Washington needs a decent return...

1370
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,170
...in order to give Gruff
a shot to tie the game.

1371
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,280
With 12 seconds remaining...

1372
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:10,990
-It's yours, Nigel.
-...a 32-yard field goal...

1373
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,160
...will send this game into overtime.

1374
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:16,040
Thirty-two yards is just
a chip shot for Gruff.

1375
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:33,310
Are you all right?

1376
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:36,020
I'm sorry.

1377
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:39,230
I had the money but I pissed it
away down the track again.

1378
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,780
What? What are you talking about?

1379
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:43,780
They'll take my pub away from me.

1380
01:46:43,950 --> 01:46:45,580
It's all I've got.

1381
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:47,990
Come on, Shane!

1382
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:04,010
It's a fake! Falco still has it!
He's running with it!

1383
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,320
Touchdown, Falco!

1384
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:31,880
Holding! Number 68 on the offense.

1385
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:34,800
Ten-yard penalty. Repeat first down.

1386
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:36,720
What a terrible call!

1387
01:47:36,970 --> 01:47:38,430
Time out!

1388
01:47:41,810 --> 01:47:44,480
-You okay?
-I broke my arm.

1389
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:46,730
Cheers. You saved my ass.

1390
01:47:47,310 --> 01:47:48,400
Take care.

1391
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:51,190
You'll have to explain to me
what that was about.

1392
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:54,360
What's it gonna be?

1393
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,820
I want the ball.

1394
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:59,160
Winners always do.

1395
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:01,790
Spread formation.

1396
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:10,760
Damn!

1397
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:20,100
Sorry, Shane. I'm sorry, everybody.

1398
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:23,190
No problem.
Just rip someone's head off on this one.

1399
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,480
Consider it done.

1400
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:28,690
All right. So besides me,
who really wants the ball?

1401
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:31,740
Yeah, you want it, Brian.

1402
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:35,740
Let's hook up.
DC Left, Wide Motion, 88 War.

1403
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:37,120
Gentlemen...

1404
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:44,630
It's been an honor to share
the field of battle with you.

1405
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:13,410
We ain't losing this game.

1406
01:49:34,730 --> 01:49:35,730
Green 86!

1407
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:42,700
Green 86!

1408
01:50:18,530 --> 01:50:21,280
Touchdown, Brian Murphy!

1409
01:50:22,410 --> 01:50:26,080
I knew it! I knew it all along!

1410
01:50:26,290 --> 01:50:29,790
Jimmy, you beautiful son of a bitch!
I knew you could do it!

1411
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:34,260
Final score: Washington 20, Dallas 17.

1412
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:37,800
Washington goes to the playoffs!

1413
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:48,400
You did it!

1414
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:50,980
You did it!

1415
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:02,360
When the replacement players
for the Sentinels left the stadium...

1416
01:52:02,610 --> 01:52:04,570
...there was no ticker-tape parade...

1417
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:07,280
...no endorsement deals for sneakers...

1418
01:52:07,530 --> 01:52:10,370
...or soda pop or breakfast cereal...

1419
01:52:10,570 --> 01:52:12,950
...just a locker to be cleaned out...

1420
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:15,250
...and a ride home to catch.

1421
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:17,370
But what they didn't know...

1422
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:20,380
...was that their lives
would be changed forever...

1423
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:23,420
...because they had been
part of something great.

1424
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,930
And greatness, no matter how brief...

1425
01:52:27,130 --> 01:52:29,100
...stays with a man.

1426
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:32,430
Every athlete dreams of a second chance.

1427
01:52:32,930 --> 01:52:34,890
These men lived it.
